# Massa's Autonomous Smart Contracts

Massa's Autonomous Smart Contracts address the challenges of reliability, sophistication, and centralization that plague dApps 
seeking to offer automated smart-contract execution on behalf of their users. 
These innovative smart contracts introduce the ability to self-wake, granting them the power to autonomously perform arbitrary operations. 
For instance, they can be programmed to trigger specific calls when predefined exchange rate targets within liquid pools are met.
