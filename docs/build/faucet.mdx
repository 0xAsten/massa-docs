# Faucets

On this page you'll find information about faucets for the various Massa networks.

## What is a faucet?

A faucet in the context of a blockchain domain refers to a mechanism that distributes small amounts of cryptocurrency to users for free. It acts as a digital faucet, allowing individuals to obtain a small portion of a specific cryptocurrency without the need for extensive mining or purchasing. Faucets serve multiple purposes within the blockchain ecosystem. They act as a means to introduce new users to cryptocurrencies by providing them with a small amount to get started. Additionally, faucets can facilitate the testing and development of blockchain applications by offering developers a way to acquire the necessary tokens for experimentation.
