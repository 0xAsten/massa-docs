# Massa Standard

Massa-standard is the ideal starting point to kickstart your project, whether you're interested in tokens, NFTs, or wallet creation. It offers reference implementations of the most prevalent smart contracts, enabling you to quickly and efficiently integrate these functionalities into your project.

## Fungible Tokens (FT)

FT is a standard for creating fungible, tradable tokens on the Massa blockchain. It includes a set of functions that allow for seamless interaction with tokens within smart contracts and wallets.

## Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT)

NFT is a standard for creating unique, non-fungible tokens on the Massa blockchain. This allows the creation and management of tokens where each instance has a unique value or properties.

## Massa Domain Name Service (DNS)

It streamlines the creation of a link between the hostname (website name), resolver address (where the smart contract and chunks of the website are located), and the DNS record owner.

## Massa Units Standard
The Massa Units standard defines common units of measurement for the Massa blockchain, including:

- Massa coin
