In the blockchain ecosystem, standards serve as crucial pillars fostering interoperability and seamless interaction across diverse platforms and applications. This page offers a comprehensive overview of the standardsâ€”including token, contract, unit definitions.

## Fungible Tokens (FT)

FT is a standard for creating fungible, tradable tokens on the Massa blockchain. It includes a set of functions that allow for seamless interaction with tokens within smart contracts and wallets.
