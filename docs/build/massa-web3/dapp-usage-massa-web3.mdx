Here are some examples of how to use the Massa Web3 API for dApp development.

## Calling a smart contract

Full code of the Age dApp is available [here](https://github.com/massalabs/massa-sc-examples/tree/main/age).

Here is the [age smart contract](https://github.com/massalabs/massa-sc-examples/blob/main/age/contracts/assembly/contracts/main.ts).
It allows you to store and read an age value for a given person name.
We want our frontend to call the smart contract and change the age value associated to Alice.

After creating a react app with `npx create-react-app helloworld` and setting up the Massa Web3 API as described in the
[installation](/docs/build/massa-web3#installation) section, we can call the smart contract method `changeAge` like this:

```typescript
let args = new Args().addString(inputName).addU32(newAge);
let opId = await client.smartContracts().callSmartContract({
  targetAddress: CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
  functionName: "changeAge",
  parameter: args.serialize(),
  maxGas: BigInt(1000000),
  coins: BigInt(0),
  fee: BigInt(0),
});
```
[Github redirection](https://github.com/massalabs/massa-sc-examples/blob/age/react/src/App.tsx#L42)

Since that method requires a string and an integer as parameters, we need to serialize them first. The `Args` class 
provides a convenient way to do that. You can learn more about [Args here](/docs/usage-massa-web3#args).
If the call is successful, we get an operation id back, you can then use it to check the status of the operation with the [explorer](https://buildnet.massa.net/#explorer)

## Reading a smart contract value

We now want to read the new age value we just set to display it in our frontend. You can directly read smart contract datastore values
 with the `readSmartContractData` method, which does not require any gas or fee:

```typescript
      const res = await client.smartContracts().readSmartContract({
        maxGas: BigInt(1000000),
        targetAddress: CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
        targetFunction: "getAge",
        parameter: new Args().addString(inputName).serialize(),
      });
    
    const age = res.returnValue;
```
