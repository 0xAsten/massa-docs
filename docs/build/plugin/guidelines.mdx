# Plugin Creation Guidelines

One of the advantages of Massa Station is its flexibility in allowing plugins to be developed in any programming language. In order for modules to work with Massa Station, they must adhere to specific guidelines and specifications.

> In the context of Massa Station, the terms "plugin" and "module" are used interchangeably to refer to the same thing, which is an extension or additional functionality that can be developed to work with Massa Station.

## Plugin Overview

Massa Station plugins are essentially binaries with a few specific requirements, as defined in this document. To be installed in Massa Station, a plugin must be released as a Zip Archive, tailored for each targeted operating system. Currently, Massa Station supports the following OS configurations:

- Windows 10/11, AMD64
- Linux, AMD64
- macOS, AMD64
- macOS, ARM64

For details on the supported OS configurations, refer to [the Massa Station documentation](../wallet/massa-station.mdx).

## Plugin Structure

A plugin Zip Archive must contain the following files and adhere to the specified structure:

1. **Logo**: The archive must include a valid image file that serves as the plugin's logo. Refer to [the Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Image_types) for valid image formats.

2. **Manifest**: The plugin must have a `manifest.json` file at the root of the Zip Archive. This manifest provides essential information to Massa Station for displaying the plugin in the user interface. The `manifest.json` file must include the following properties:

   | Field       | Description                   | Format | Specifications                                                   |
   | ----------- | ----------------------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | Author      | Module author's name          | text   | Maximum 30 characters                                            |
   | Name        | Module name                   | text   | Maximum 30 characters                                            |
   | Description | Module short description text | text   | Maximum 80 characters                                            |
   | Logo        | Module logo file name         | text   | Example: logo.png                                                |
   | Home        | URL to module home page       | URL    | Format: `http(s)://example.com`                                  |
   | Version     | Module version                | text   | Follow [Semantic Versioning 2.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0) |
   | APIspec     | API specifications            | text   | Swagger file                                                     |

   > See the example manifest of the Hello-World plugin: [Hello-World Manifest](https://github.com/massalabs/station-massa-hello-world/blob/v0.0.8/manifest.json)

3. **Plugin Code**: The plugin's binary code and any additional resources required for its functionality should be included.

## Plugin Registration

Upon startup, the plugin receives an ID as a parameter. The plugin must register itself as a MassaStation plugin by calling the `/plugin-manager/register` endpoint of Massa Station, providing the assigned ID.

## Language Agnostic Plugin Development

Massa Station allows plugin development in any programming language. While we may use Go in specific documentation, such as the "create plugin" guide, it's essential to emphasize that the plugin system is language agnostic, which is a key strength of Massa Station. Developers have the freedom to use their preferred programming language to create plugins that work seamlessly with Massa Station.

For detailed steps on creating a plugin, please refer to the "create plugin" guide available [here](./create-plugin.mdx).
