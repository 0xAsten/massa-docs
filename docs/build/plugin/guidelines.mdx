# Plugin creation guidelines

One of the advantages of Massa Station is that plugins can be developed in any programming language. But in order for modules to work on the Massa Station, they must first respect a certain number of guidelines.

> In the context of Massa Station, the terms "plugin" and "module" are used interchangeably to refer to the same thing, which is an extension or additional functionality that can be developed to work with Massa Station.


## Tech Stack

You can develop a plugin in any wanted language. The easiest way is to use Go.

### Develop a plugin in Go

You can follow the steps described [here](./createplugin.mdx)

### Develop a plugin in any other language

Your plugin will need to call **the Register Endpoint** to be compatible with Massa Station: The plugin should be able to call the `/plugin-manager/register` endpoint of Massastation, as defined in [MassaStation Swagger File](https://github.com/massalabs/station/blob/v0.2.5/api/swagger/server/restapi/resource/swagger.yml#L481).

## Artifact requirements

To be compatible with Massa Station, the plugin zip archive must contain the following files :

### Logo

There must be a plugin logo in the zip archive. it must be a [valid image file](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Image_types)

### Module manifest

The manifest will provide the necessary information to the Massa Station to display the plugin in the UI. It must be a `manifest.json` file at the root of the artifact. It must contain the following properties:

| Fields      | Description                   | Format | Specifications                                                  |
