# Local network generation
Here, you will learn how to launch a local network with custom settings, initial coins and rolls distribution.

Clone massa:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:massalabs/massa.git
```

Compile it with the sandbox feature enabled:

```bash
cd massa && cargo build --release --features sandbox
```

Create a keypair in massa-client:

```bash
cd massa-client && cargo run
wallet_generate_secret_key
```

For the rest of the tutorial we will use theses abbreviations:

- `SECRETK`: The secret you just generated
- `PUBK`: The public key corresponding to SECRETK
- `ADDR`: The address corresponding to PUBK

Setup your node to use the secret you just generated as its public key and staking key:
- modify or create the file `massa-node/config/node_privkey.key`:

    ```bash
    {"secret_key":"SECRETK","public_key":"PUBK"}
    ```

- modify the file `massa-node/base_config/initial_ledger.json`:

    ```javascript
    {
        "ADDR": {
            "balance": "80000000",
            "datastore": {},
            "bytecode": []
        }
    }
    ```

- CLEAR and modify the file `massa-node/base_config/initial_rolls.json`:

    ```javascript
    {
        "ADDR": 100
    }
    ```

- CLEAR content of `massa-node/base_config/initial_vesting.json`:

    ```javascript
    {}
    ```

You can now launch your node:
```bash
cd massa-node && cargo run --features sandbox
```

On your client run the following command to add your secret key as staking key:

```bash
cd massa-client && cargo run node_start_staking ADDR
```

The local network and your node will start after 10 seconds. Once it is started, you can interact with it using the CLI
client as you would with a testnet node.
