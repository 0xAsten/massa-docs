### Massa Station isn't starting

To check what is happening, you can open the Massa Station logs. See [Get Massa Station logs](#get-massa-station-logs) to know how to get them.

Once you have the logs, please go at the end of the file and look for the last error. If you see an error like this:

```
listen tcp :80: bind: address already in use
```

That means that another application is already using the port 80. You can either stop the application using the port 80 or change its port.


### When opening Massa Station, I get a page with the error "DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN"

This error means that your computer can't resolve the domain name of the Massa Station. This might be because you
unselected the option to install the DNS server during the installation of the Massa Station.

To fix this, you can either reinstall the Massa Station and make sure to select the option to install the DNS server
or you can manually change your DNS server to redirect the Massa Station domain name to your computer as explained in
the [manual installation](/docs/massaStation/manual-install#handle-massa-redirection) section.

If the DNS server is installed, the problem might be that your web browser is using another DNS server.
In Chromium based browsers, you can go to your browser settings and search for "Use secure DNS" and disable it.

If the problem persists, please open an issue with the logs of the Massa Station as explained in the
[Get Massa Station logs](#get-massa-station-logs) section.


### When opening Massa Station, I get a page with the error "ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED"

This error means that your computer can't connect to the Massa Station.
This might be because the Massa Station isn't running or because the redirection to `station.massa` isn't working.

Please check that the Massa Station is running and retry to open https://station.massa/ in your web browser.

If you still have the error, please open http://localhost/ in your web browser.
If you get the same error, that means that the Massa Station isn't running. In that case, please follow the instructions provided in the [Massa Station isn't starting](#massa-station-isnt-starting) section.
