### The installation fails because it is unsupported. What do I do?

For now, Massa Station is only supported on Windows 10 and 11, MacOS 12 and later, and Debian based Linux distributions.

If you are using an unsupported operating system, you can still try to install Massa Station manually by following the instructions on the [manual installation page](/docs/massaStation/manual-install).


### I can't install Massa Station because it is blocked by my antivirus. What do I do?

We want to assure you that Massa Station is free from viruses, and the antivirus warning is a false positive. We're in the process of obtaining necessary certificates (such as from Apple for MacOS versions), which can trigger such warnings. 
Being a blockchain app, Massa Station interacts with distant servers and performs cryptographic operations. Antivirus warnings for new apps in this category are common but are mostly not indicative of any threat. If you are using an antivirus that blocks Massa Station, you can try to add Massa Station to the whitelist.

Massa Station’s code is publicly accessible and auditable on [GitHub](https://github.com/massalabs/station), which means that anybody can check what’s happening. It’s part of our commitment to transparency and security.
