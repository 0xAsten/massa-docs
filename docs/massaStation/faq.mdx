### Antivirus blocked installation of Massa Station. What to do?

We want to assure you that Massa Station is free from viruses, and the antivirus warning is a false positive. We're in the process of obtaining necessary certificates (such as from Apple for MacOS versions), which can trigger such warnings.
Being a blockchain app, Massa Station interacts with distant servers and performs cryptographic operations. Antivirus warnings for new apps in this category are common but are mostly not indicative of any threat. If you are using an antivirus that blocks Massa Station, you can try to add Massa Station to the whitelist.

Massa Station’s code is publicly accessible and auditable on [GitHub](https://github.com/massalabs/station), which means that anybody can check what’s happening. It’s part of our commitment to transparency and security.

### Why can't I use Massa Station on mobile?

Massa Station is a desktop super-app that, once opened, operates within your web browser. A mobile version is not available at this time.

### Why can't I see modules in module store?

The module store is hosted on GitHub. If you are in a country that blocks GitHub, you will not be able to see the modules.

We are working on a solution to this problem, but in the meantime, you can install modules manually using the right panel of the module store.

For example with the Massa Wallet module:

1. Go to the [latest Massa Wallet release page](https://github.com/massalabs/station-massa-wallet/releases/latest).
2. Copy the URL of the `.zip` file corresponding to your operating system.
3. Paste the URL in the right panel of the module store and click on "Install".

### Why can't I access Massa Station from my browser?

Massa Station must be installed and running on your computer to be able to access it from your browser. If you have installed Massa Station, please make sure it is running.

If Massa Station is running, please check that you are using the correct URL. The URL should be `https://station.massa/`.

If you are still having trouble accessing Massa Station, please check the [troubleshooting page](/docs/massaStation/troubleshooting) for help.

### "Install" module button doesn't work. What to do?
