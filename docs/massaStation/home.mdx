## Introduction to Massa Station

*Massa Station* is a desktop application that provides an intuitive way to interact with the Massa blockchain through
your web browser.

If you're not a developer or simply prefer a more visual approach, using *Massa Station* is ideal for you.

*Massa Station* is the gateway to the Massa Blockchain. You can think of it as an application store for modules that
leverage the exciting features of the Massa Blockchain. *Massa Station* comes in the form of a desktop application with
some core modules pre-installed. For example, directly out of the box, *Massa Station* allows you to access Massa's
[Decentralized Web](/docs/learn/decentralized-web). 

:::info
Once installed on your machine, *Massa Station* will allow your browser to resolve `.massa` url domains and interact
with decentralized applications hosted on Massa. When using *Massa Station*, the `.massa` url domain indicates that you
are visiting a website that is hosted on-chain, and directly served to you. You can learn more about Decentralized Web
[here](/docs/learn/decentralized-web).

Another core module of *Massa Station* that is already available is the [Massa Wallet](/build/wallet/massa-station.mdx).
It allows you to manage your Massa accounts, and sign and send transactions with an experience similar to a traditional
browser-plugin wallet, but with enhanced security.

Besides the core modules developed by the Massa team, *Massa Station* was designed with community and modularity in
mind; indeed, it allows anyone to develop and install their own modules. The most looked upon modules in terms of
community adoption, and upon audit, will be made publicly available through the Massa Plugin Store. We greatly encourage
our community to develop their own modules, as we believe that the *Massa Station* ecosystem will be the key to the
adoption of the Massa Blockchain.

### Installation

#### System Requirements:

- **Operating System**: The latest versions of Windows, Mac, and Debian-based Linux distributions
- **Disk Space**: At least 200 MB
- **RAM**: At least 2 GB

To install *Massa Station*, follow these steps:

1. Visit the [Massa Station website](https://station.massa.net/).
2. Click the **Download** button and select the version compatible with your operating system.
3. Once the download is complete, run the installer and follow the instructions.

:::info
During the installation process, you will be prompted to grant permissions to *Massa Station*.
These permissions are necessary for *Massa Station* to function correctly.

:::caution
When launching *Massa Station* for the first time on Windows, you will be asked to accept the installation of some
certificates.
These certificates allow *Massa Station* to use the HTTPS protocol, which improves your security when
[browsing dApp](browse-decentralized-application).

### Modules

*Massa Station* is not just a blockchain client with a user interface; it is a decentralized super app.
You can learn more about the super app concept and its strategic value
[here](https://www.gartner.com/en/articles/what-is-a-superapp).

To achieve evolvability and decentralization, *Massa Station* is designed to be extendable using **modules**, which are
also known as **plugins**.

:::tip
If you are unable or do not wish to install a thick client, you can always use one of our
[community browser extensions](https://docs.massa.net/docs/build/wallet/community-wallets).
However, by doing so, you will limit your access to the full potential of this super app.
